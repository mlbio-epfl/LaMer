You are an expert agent operating in the ALFRED Embodied Environment. 
{init_observation}

You will be given the history of a past experience.
Your job is to **reflect on the past sequence**, identify any **mistakes or inefficiencies**, and then devise a **concise, improved plan** starting from the original initial state.

Below are the actions you took and the corresponding observations:
{current_trajectory}
The task is NOT successfully completed.

Now it's your turn to reflect on the past experience and come up with a new plan of action.

- Your response should first be step-by-step reasoning about the strategy and path you took to attempt to complete the task. Identify where things went wrong or could be better.
- Then devise a concise, new plan of action that accounts for your mistake with reference to specific actions that you should have taken.
- Finally, end the response with your reflection and improved plan inside <remark> </remark> tags, to guide the next trial.
